            Operates directly out of flash using POSIX.

        help
            Reader reads entire ELF file into memory and passes in a pointer
            to the beginning of the contents. 1~2 orders of magnitude faster
            than POSIX, but requires more RAM.

        bool "Linear search through exported symbols"
        help
            Input symbols from HOST can be in any order, but takes O(n) to find
            a symbol.
    config ELFLOADER_SEARCH_BINARY
        bool "Binary search through exported symbols"
        help
            Input symbols from HOST must be in alphabetical order.
            Takes O(log(n)) to find a symbol.

config ELFLOADER_PROFILER_EN
    bool
    prompt "Enable ELF Loader Profiling"
    default n
    help
        Enable profiling tools. Takes up additional memory and some CPU cycles.

config ELFLOADER_CACHE_SHSTRTAB
    bool
    depends on ELFLOADER_POSIX
    prompt "Cache Section Header StringTable to Memory"
    default y
    help
        Allocates memory to cache the .shstrtab section to memory. In tests, 
        this occupies ~4KB of memory (depends on number of symbols and name 
        length, just provided here for a magnitude estimate) and made loading 
        500mS faster.

config ELFLOADER_CACHE_SECTIONS
    bool
    depends on ELFLOADER_POSIX
    prompt "Cache Sections as they are read"
    default y
    help
        Allocates memory for every section read to reduce repeated flash reads.
        Frees these sections after loading is complete.

config ELFLOADER_CACHE_LOCALITY
    bool
    depends on ELFLOADER_POSIX
    prompt "Read ahead as filesystem is accessed"
    default y
    help
        help text here.

    depends on ELFLOADER_CACHE_LOCALITY
    prompt "Read ahead as filesystem is accessed"

        chunk size for read ahead in bytes.

    int
    depends on ELFLOADER_CACHE_LOCALITY
    prompt "Number of chunks to cache"

    range 0 255
    help
        number of chunks to cache.
